                            <p>
                                Born and raised in Kolkata, Anuvab obtained his B.Sc. degree from Presidency College in
                                2013. During his undergraduate studies, he gained his first research experience in Prof.
                                Abhishek Deyâ€™s lab at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, where he studied
                                the spectroelectrochemical properties of novel porphyrinic compounds. He then pursued
                                M.Sc. at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur, conducting his masterâ€™s thesis
                                research in Prof. Jayanta K. Rayâ€™s lab, where he developed a new generation of palladium
                                catalysts for annulation reactions.

                                In 2015, Anuvab moved to Texas A&M University to pursue his Ph.D. under the guidance of
                                Prof. David C. Powers. His graduate research focused on structurally characterizing transient
                                intermediates involved in nitrene transfer reactions using in situ crystallography. After
                                completing his Ph.D. in 2020, he joined Prof. Frances H. Arnoldâ€™s group at the California
                                Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral researcher. There, he developed new-to-nature
                                amination reactions by engineering heme proteins using directed evolution and
                                spectroscopically characterizing the intermediates involved.

                                In 2025, Anuvab joined the School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Biotechnology
                                at Nanyang Technological University as an Assistant Professor.
