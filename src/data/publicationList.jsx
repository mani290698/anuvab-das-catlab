    date: "2024-12-10",
    author: "Dr. Jane Doe",
    journal: "Engineered hemoproteins can selectively incorporate nitrogen from nitrene precursors like hydroxylamine, O-substituted hydroxylamines, and organic azides into organic molecules. Although iron-nitrenoids are often invoked as the reactive intermediates in these reactions, their innate reactivity and transient nature have made their characterization challenging."
